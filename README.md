# dotfiles
My saved configurations and scripts for Linux usage

## /etc/
Settings for VNC autostart and fixing the backlight of my laptop

## /home/
Contains dotfiles which belong in a home folder
* .config/i3/config
* .config/i3status/i3status.conf
* .irssi/config
* .bashrc
* .gitconfig
* .gruvbox.minttyrc
* .my_alias
* .tmux.conf

## /how
I have some alias for using *cat* on different text files, e.g., with *howgit* I get some commands shown in my terminal that I use often with git. I also keep
notes about installing various software that I need after installing Linux. I can just copy paste what I need until that day I make a script for it.

## /scripts
* ttitle.py
* hex_to_int.py
* int_to_hex.py
* terminal_color_palette.sh
